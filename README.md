# WELCOME TO PASSWORD FUSION 

> *** This is a peronal project for training purposes. The vision of this project is to use Tkinter and various hashing techniques.

** There are two current main folders to look at for running the file.

# installation | running the app

1 Use `virtualenv venv --python=python3` to install a virtual env in order to install the requirements
2 Once installed use `source venv/bin/activate` to enter the virtualenv
3 Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install required applications.
4 Run `python main.py` to launch the CLI application


To view the GUI app, which does not work, take a look at the file: user_dashboard.py
